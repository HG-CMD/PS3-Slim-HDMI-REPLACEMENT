### Step 1

Disassemble the PS3 until you can have the motherboard free. I recommend [ifixit's guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Sony_TV_Console), again, choose your console's model. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you can't separate the motherboard from the metal heatsink, heat the backside of the RSX (GPU) and the CELL Processor using the hot air gun or a hair dryer, or play a game before disassembly.
