> This is not an in-depth guide; I am not responsible for any damage caused to your console.

While you can follow these same steps for any PS3, the HDMI port will vary by model.

### Step 1

Disassemble the PS3 until you can remove the motherboard. I recommend [ifixit's guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Sony_TV_Console), again, choose your console's model. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you can't separate the motherboard from the metal heatsink, heat the backside of the RSX (GPU) and the CELL Processor using the hot air gun or a hair dryer, or play a game before disassembly.

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend replacing the cell battery of the motherboard, it´s on the same side as the RSX and the CELL Processor. This battery is used to keep the clock "ticking", so if it is depleted, the console's internal time and date will default to the manufacturer's default.

### Step 2
Unfortunaly the console I acquired had an attempt at repairing the HDMI port, so it looks like this

Port Top                   |  Port Front               | Port Pins

I don't know what happened here, but it's atrocious.

Since somebody has worked on it before, I am going to clean the leftover burnt flux using IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol), so it looks like this



### Step 3

After cleaning it, get your soldering iron ready because we are going to flow the leaded solder to reduce the melting point of the already present solder.

1. Make sure the soldering iron tip is clean, for this I am going to use this tip (imagem)
2. Heat up the soldering iron to 320°C and wait for it to reach that temperature, in the mean time aplly flux to the solder point on the board (Setas a apontar
3. Now aproach the solder wire to the solder points and melt the solder on to the already existing one, you don't need to put much and start by the mounting points of the port (Imagem)
4. Turn off the soldering iron

> [!TIP]
> Make that you clean the tip of the soldering iron (while it's hot) on the copper ball after using it.

### Step 4

Now we can start the removel of the port

1. Heat up the hot gun on slow fan speed at 340°C and grab a pair of tweazers
2. Aproach the hot gun to the port, but make sure to heat up the surrounding part evenly (GIF)
3. Now start to focus on the port, when you see the solder joints start to shine they have melted and you can remove the port. (GIF)
