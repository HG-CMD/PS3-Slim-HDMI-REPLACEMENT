While you can follow these same steps for any PS3, the HDMI port will change according to the model you have.

### Step 1

Disassemble the PS3 until you can remove the motherboard. I recommend [ifixit's guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Sony_TV_Console), again, choose your console's model. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you can't separate the motherboard from the metal heatsink, heat the backside of the RSX (GPU) and the CELL Processor using the hot air gun or a hair dryer, or play a game before disassembly.

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend replacing the cell battery of the motherboard, it´s on the same side as the RSX and the CELL Processor. This battery is usde to keep the clock "ticking", so if it depleted the consoles internal time and date will default to the manufacturers default 

### Step 2
Unfortunaly the console I acquired had an attempt at repairing the HDMI port, so it looks like this

Port Top                   |  Port Front               | Port Pins

I don't know what happend here but it's atroucious.

Since somebody has worked on before i am going to clean the lefover burnt flux using IPA (Isopropyl Alchool) so it looks like this
